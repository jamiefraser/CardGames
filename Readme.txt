The idea here is to allow people to define their own games they can play online with other people (not robots, people).  To do that we're going to keep things as simple as possible.

GameTable:  Here's where users gather to play a Game.  A game table provides a container for users as well as a concrete instance of a Game, and a container for keeping score.  Game rules are enforced by players rather than the system

Game:  The definition of a game including the type of deck(s), the number of deck(s), whether wild cards should be included in the deck(s), the number of cards per hand, whether there's a discard pile users card draw from, whether the user only takes the top card from the discard pile or the whole pile
